# Data Exploration and Visualization

## Overview
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to analyze and manipulate data sets with Pandas and Plotly. The tasks range from manipulating a simple fruit dataset to extracting insights from a baby names dataset take from online. This notebook also explores an election dataset to identify winning political parties.

## Features
- **Data Manipulation:** Utilizes Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes an example of plotting data with Plotly.
- **Data Import:** Demonstrates how to download and read data directly from the web.
- **Complex Queries:** Showcases filtering and sorting data to derive meaningful insights.

## Usage
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells in sequence to observe the results. Each cell contains comments that guide the user through the steps performed.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

## Input
The notebook processes several datasets:
- A manually created fruit dataset within the notebook.
- A baby names dataset downloaded from `https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip`.
- An elections dataset expected to be in CSV format within the working directory.

## Output
The outputs are manipulated data tables and data visualizations which can be viewed directly within the Jupyter notebook's interface.

# Notes
- Ensure all CSV files are placed in the same directory as the notebook or update the file paths accordingly.
- Visual outputs are generated using plotly and might require internet access for interactive components.
